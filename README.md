# Mangastream Scraper

This simple project was built to reintroduce myself to the wonderful wonders of webscraping with BeautifulSoup and python

It can be used to notify users whenever their new favorite manga chapters have been updated.

To use this module simply edit the favorite_mangas.json file and replace the current titles with the ones of your choosing (although this list is amazing and should just be appended....)

It was also a test run in sending emails to my gmail account

which is why GMAIL_USERNAME and GMAIL_PASSWORD should be set in the mangastream_crawler.py file or with environment variables.

## Have Fun and happy reading
